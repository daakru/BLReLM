# BLReLM
An application to make building loadouts for use with BLRevive and MagiCow's BLRevive server bot easier and more descriptive.

## Blacklight Revive Loadout Manager
This project is still in early phases of development but I wanted to get a version with basic functionality available.

The executable should run without requiring any version of python to be installed.

Please let me know if there's any problems running the application.

### Usage
Before launching, open `settings.json` with notepad.exe or another text editor and change "Player" to be your Player Name used in the BLRevive Launcher.

Double click an item in the list control to equip it in the currently selected weapon.

Click on the Gear Slot Icons (Receiver, Stock, Barrel, Scope) to switch which one is being set, and the Primary and Secondary Icons to change the weapon and loadout you are equipping.

The `register` text for your loadouts that you can copy and send to MagiCow's Server bot will be dynamically updated in the bottom right.
